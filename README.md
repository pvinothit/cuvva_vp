# Strings Update
   Strings get updated on every app launch from here http://www.mocky.io/v2/5c699176370000a90a07fd6f

# UI
   I hope the task is mainly on parsing the event streams and processing to make it work for given screens. So haven't focused much on UI.   
   
# Time Spend on the task
   I have rougly spent 10 - 13 hrs on it.
  
# Tests
   I would love to right the tests first but given the time constraints i haven't added many tests as i would like to have. Though i have added for main event processing logic. But tests can be added easily by the way it's structured.

# Improvements(If more time)
   • Theming can be improved by having configurable structure. Like create different themes and switch between those if needed. Eg between dark and light theme.
   • Constraints - Can be imporved
